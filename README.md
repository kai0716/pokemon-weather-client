## Pokemon Weather Application - Client

A one-page mobile phone pokemon weather application built for a 5 hour hackathon with <a href="https://github.com/kai0716">Kevin</a>.  

Search for the suggested pokemon, while receiving the weather, and depending on the weather a variety of mocktails are given to enjoy after the search.  

The application front-end is built with React and we implement our own APIs and those from Weatherbit.

Create .env file with the following variable 
REACT_APP_APIKEY

Go to weatherbit and request and api key.
